    I'm a full stack developer and product builder with 6+ years of experience creating digital products for startups, businesses, and entrepreneurs. My journey began as a freelancer, collaborating with international teams and agencies to ship scalable web apps, SaaS platforms, and data-driven solutions. 

    I specialize in full project ownership—from design and frontend to backend, cloud, and automation. My work powers platforms with thousands of users, AI learning assistants, payment systems, and custom business websites. 

    I love learning new tech, mentoring others, and building products that solve real problems.
